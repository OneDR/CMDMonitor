# CMDMonitor

## What Does It Do?
CMDMonitor allows you to monitor your server via/ssh and excecute commands at the click of a button!

## Why Did We Make CMDMonitor.

Often in times when we are in a rush to check on our servers, or just to restart a specific program on our servers, remembering complex commands becomes a pain. CMDMonitor simplifys this process dramatically by allowing the user to interact with their server via SSH.

## Why Is This Different From Aliases?

Although mainly it is not different, the GUI allows the user to use commands without the posiblily of them colliding with each other. Another great perk that CMDMonitor offers is real time server stats, like processor usage, availible space, and ram usage.

## How to add commands

We have added several very usefull commands. But there may not be enough. If you would like us to add a certain command to our program just navigate to the commands.json file and repeat the format you see there to add more commands

## Installation

CMDMonitor is super easy to install. We will make it specially simple by making .sh files for the linux version, which install all the nessisary compounents ofr CMDMonitor as well as add them to launchers. As well as simple launchers for Windows.

### Linux Installation
